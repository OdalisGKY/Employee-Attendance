 Intro:

 1. This code is a .py file (used and ran with Python).
 2. GUI populates when code is ran.
 3. Prompts if you would like to add any data.
 4. Data that can be entered:

    a. Employee name that you are needing to input data on.
    b. Days of Absences for employee.
    c. User can enter new employee if needed after data is entered.
 5. Data graph populates after inputs
 6. Graph in red captures employee missed over 3 days.

Future Enhancements:

1. User can remove employees that should no longer be in the system.
2. User can update Employee name and missed days.
4. Email sent to employee notifying days of absence when over 3 within the year.
5. Supervisor notes added for absences (comment section needs to be added for each user)
6. Make it into an actual app (mobile/desktop/tablet)

Conclusion:
 The purpose of this data is for supervisor to keep track of accessive missed days per year for employees.
 This is aimed for small business with no more than 50 employees.
 Emails (if available) are sent to keep the employee aware of their attendance.
